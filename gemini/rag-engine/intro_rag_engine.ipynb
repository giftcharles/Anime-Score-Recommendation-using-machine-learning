        "\n",
        "A common problem with LLMs is that they don't understand private knowledge, that\n",
        "is, your organization's data. With RAG Engine, you can enrich the\n",
        "LLM context with additional private information, because the model can reduce\n",
        "hallucinations and answer questions more accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "By combining additional knowledge sources with the existing knowledge that LLMs\n",
        "have, a better context is provided. The improved context along with the query\n",
        "enhances the quality of the LLM's response.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following concepts are key to understanding Vertex AI RAG Engine. These concepts are listed in the order of the\n",
        "retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data ingestion**: Intake data from different data sources. For example,\n",
        "  local files, Google Cloud Storage, and Google Drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data transformation**: Conversion of the data in preparation for indexing. For example, data is split into chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Embedding**: Numerical representations of words or pieces of text. These numbers capture the\n",
        "   semantic meaning and context of the text. Similar or related words or text\n",
        "   tend to have similar embeddings, which means they are closer together in the\n",
        "   high-dimensional vector space.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data indexing**: RAG Engine creates an index called a corpus.\n",
        "   The index structures the knowledge base so it's optimized for searching. For\n",
        "   example, the index is like a detailed table of contents for a massive\n",
        "   reference book.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Retrieval**: When a user asks a question or provides a prompt, the retrieval\n",
        "  component in RAG Engine searches through its knowledge\n",
        "  base to find information that is relevant to the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Generation**: The retrieved information becomes the context added to the\n",
        "  original user query as a guide for the generative AI model to generate\n",
        "  factually grounded and relevant responses.\n",

        "\n",
        "**What it is:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Combining Retrieval and Generation:**\n",
        "    * RAG combines the strengths of information retrieval systems (like search engines) with the generative power of LLMs.\n",
        "    * It enables LLMs to go beyond their pre-trained data and access up-to-date and specific information.\n",
        "* **How it works:**\n",
        "    * When a user asks a question, the RAG system first retrieves relevant information from external data sources (e.g., databases, documents, web pages).\n",
        "    * This retrieved information is then provided to the LLM as additional context.\n",
        "    * The LLM uses this augmented context to generate a more accurate and informative response.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why it's helpful:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Access to Up-to-Date Information:**\n",
        "    * LLMs are trained on static datasets, so their knowledge can become outdated. RAG allows them to access real-time or frequently updated information.\n",
        "* **Improved Accuracy and Factual Grounding:**\n",
        "    * RAG reduces the risk of LLM \"hallucinations\" (generating false or misleading information) by grounding responses in verified external data.\n",
        "* **Enhanced Contextual Relevance:**\n",
        "    * By providing relevant context, RAG enables LLMs to generate more precise and tailored responses to specific queries.\n",
        "* **Increased Trust and Transparency:**\n",
        "    * RAG can provide source citations, allowing users to verify the information and increasing trust in the LLM's responses.\n",
        "* **Cost Efficiency:**\n",
        "    * Rather than constantly retraining large language models, RAG allows for the introduction of new data in a more cost effective way.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, RAG bridges the gap between the vast knowledge of LLMs and the need for accurate, current, and contextually relevant information.\n"

The proposed system development will comply with e-Government \\r\\nstandards and guidelines.\\r\\n2.5 TMX Processes Overview\\r\\nThis section aims to give the general overview of the TMX processes by providing the \\r\\nTMX processes map and later providing a brief description of each main process in the \\r\\nTMX system.TMX SRS\\r\\n8\\r\\n2.5.1 Processes Map\\r\\nThe following Figure 1 gives a clear illustration of the main processes in the TMX \\r\\nsystem and further provides clustering of sub-processes in various main processes and \\r\\nalso supporting processes that help core processes to work properly.\\r\\nFigure 1: TMX Processes Map\\r\\n2.5.2 User Registration\\r\\nTraders will have self-registration options with approval done by TMX authorised \\r\\nofficer. TMX staff will have their account creation through the administrator. Once \\r\\nregistered, user will have access to dashboard and functionalities according to defined \\r\\nroles and permission.\\r\\n2.6 TMX System/solution concept\\r\\nThis section focuses on the system/solution concept. First it gives the overview of the \\r\\nTMX system concept. Then, depicts the TMX system concept and lastly, this section \\r\\ngives the detailed description of the system concept that involves integration of \\r\\nvarious existing systems through Application Program Interface (API).\\r\\n2.6.1 System Concept Description\\r\\nTrade Operations Unit\\r\\nRegistration of Traders\\r\\n(Buyers, Brokers and\\r\\nSellers)\\r\\nConfirming Buyer’s\\r\\nPosition\\r\\nPre-Trade Session Trade Session Post-Trade Session\\r\\nTrade Operations Unit and Corporate Services Unit\\r\\nClearing and Settlement\\r\\nProcess\\r\\nDelivery\\r\\nTMX CORE BUSINESS PROCESSES\\r\\nTMX SUPPORTING\\r\\nPROCESSES\\r\\nHR\\r\\nFinance\\r\\nProcurement\\r\\nLegal\\r\\nICT &\\r\\nStatistics\\r\\nUnit\\r\\n.TMX SRS\\r\\n9\\r\\nThe proposed TMX system shall provide centralised services across all core TMX \\r\\noperations processes. This will reduce turnaround time of providing services to the \\r\\npublic and increase efficiency of organisation. The system will be interfaced with other \\r\\nsystems from OGDs through government Enterprise service bus, this will provide the \\r\\nproper validation of information provided by users and reduce uploading of \\r\\ndocuments.\\r\\nThe system will provide services that cut across all TMX operations departments and \\r\\nsupporting units. In addition, external users will be able to use the system for \\r\\ntrading/bidding through online accessible interface. The system will have an \\r\\napplication and will support efficient protocols for authentication and authorization of \\r\\nusers. The system will provide real time status of all operations to users.TMX SRS\\r\\n10\\r\\n2.6.2 System/Solution Concept Diagram\\r\\nThe Context diagram below shows the provisioned system to be developed or\\r\\nacquired and its interaction with stakeholders and other systems in place.\\r\\nFigure 2: System Concept DiagramTMX SRS\\r\\n11\\r\\n2.6.3 System Concept Diagram Descriptions\\r\\nThe system concept diagram Figure: 3.1 elaborates how both TMX External & Internal \\r\\nUsers interact with the TMX Portals (External and Internal) through authentication and \\r\\nauthorization provider to access different TMX Services.\\r\\nExternal Users Profile/Account will be created so as to enable users to apply and access \\r\\nTMX services. During the login process, users will be authenticated and authorised and \\r\\nbe able to access services.\\r\\nTMX internal users will be able to perform administrative, operations and support \\r\\nactivities through the TMX internal portal system. The system will provide centralised \\r\\naccess control to all TMX operations. Additionally, the system will interface through \\r\\nESB with OGD (Other Government Departments) systems such as NIDA, WRRB, TCDC, \\r\\nCOPRA, MOA, BRELA, GePG/Banks, crop boards and Others. The TMX mobile App will \\r\\nbe used by traders to do online trading.\"\n",

They represent you and approve the prices offered at auction.\n*   **Quality Grades:** Cashews are graded as either \"Standard Grade\" (Shelling Outturn ≥ 48 lbs/80 Kg bag) or \"Under Grade\" (47 ≥ Shelling Outturn ≥ 44 lbs/80 kg bag).\n*   **Lots:** Cashews are sold in \"Lots,\" which are quantities of cashews of a particular quality grade.\n*   **Pricing:** The selling price is in Tanzanian Shillings (TZS) and is \"ex-warehouse,\" meaning it doesn't include transportation from the warehouse.\n\n**Steps for Selling:**\n\n1.  **Harvest and Storage:** Harvest your cashews and store them in a designated warehouse.\n\n2.  **Grading** RCN stored in the warehouse shall be sold in two distinguishable quality grades which are Standard Grade (Shelling Outturn ≥ 48 lbs/80 Kg bag) and Under Grade (47 ≥ Shelling Outturn ≥ 44 lbs /80 kg bag);\n\n3.  **Auction Participation (through Cooperative Union):**\n    *   Your Cooperative Union will represent your cashews at the online auction.\n    *   Licensed buyers will bid on Lots of your cashews. Bidding for one Lot takes one minute. If a buyer sets a price, it will repeat for 40 seconds until another buyer sets another price.\n    *   The Cooperative Union will approve the highest bid on your behalf.\n4.  **Sales catalogue:** The licensed buyers will be provided with sales catalogues at least 12 hours before the auction.\n\n5.  **Payment to You (through Cooperative Union):**\n    *   The buyer must pay the Cooperative Union in full within five working days of the auction. Payment is made via banker's cheque/TISS to the Cooperative Union's bank account.\n    *   The Cooperative Union will then pay you, the farmer.\n\n6. **Buyer collects the cashews:** The storage period for RCN in the Warehouse after sales is 16 working days, these days will start counting after five (5) days of payment.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   The minimum bidding quantity is 50 metric tons.\n*    The RCN from Mtwara, Lindi and Ruvuma regions must be shipped through Mtwara Port. RCN bought from other areas, can be shipped through Mtwara, Dar es Salaam and Tanga ports.\n*   There are penalties for buyers who fail to pay on time. This system is designed to protect you, the farmer.\n*   Various charges and levies are paid by the buyer, including contributions to the UNION and AMCOS Operations, Crop Cess, Storage Charges, Gunny Bags, Cashew Development, Cashew Industry Management, Cashew Research, and export levy.\n*   Buyers have a limited time (16 working days) to collect the cashews from the warehouse after payment, after which they incur storage charges.\n*    Permits to transport the cashews will be issued electronically by the CBT.\n"
