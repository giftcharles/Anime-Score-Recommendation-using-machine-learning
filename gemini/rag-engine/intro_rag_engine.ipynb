        "\n",
        "A common problem with LLMs is that they don't understand private knowledge, that\n",
        "is, your organization's data. With RAG Engine, you can enrich the\n",
        "LLM context with additional private information, because the model can reduce\n",
        "hallucinations and answer questions more accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "By combining additional knowledge sources with the existing knowledge that LLMs\n",
        "have, a better context is provided. The improved context along with the query\n",
        "enhances the quality of the LLM's response.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following concepts are key to understanding Vertex AI RAG Engine. These concepts are listed in the order of the\n",
        "retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data ingestion**: Intake data from different data sources. For example,\n",
        "  local files, Google Cloud Storage, and Google Drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data transformation**: Conversion of the data in preparation for indexing. For example, data is split into chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Embedding**: Numerical representations of words or pieces of text. These numbers capture the\n",
        "   semantic meaning and context of the text. Similar or related words or text\n",
        "   tend to have similar embeddings, which means they are closer together in the\n",
        "   high-dimensional vector space.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data indexing**: RAG Engine creates an index called a corpus.\n",
        "   The index structures the knowledge base so it's optimized for searching. For\n",
        "   example, the index is like a detailed table of contents for a massive\n",
        "   reference book.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Retrieval**: When a user asks a question or provides a prompt, the retrieval\n",
        "  component in RAG Engine searches through its knowledge\n",
        "  base to find information that is relevant to the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Generation**: The retrieved information becomes the context added to the\n",

        "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allowing them to access and incorporate external data sources when generating responses. Here's a breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "**What it is:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Combining Retrieval and Generation:**\n",
        "    * RAG combines the strengths of information retrieval systems (like search engines) with the generative power of LLMs.\n",
        "    * It enables LLMs to go beyond their pre-trained data and access up-to-date and specific information.\n",
        "* **How it works:**\n",
        "    * When a user asks a question, the RAG system first retrieves relevant information from external data sources (e.g., databases, documents, web pages).\n",
        "    * This retrieved information is then provided to the LLM as additional context.\n",
        "    * The LLM uses this augmented context to generate a more accurate and informative response.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why it's helpful:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Access to Up-to-Date Information:**\n",
        "    * LLMs are trained on static datasets, so their knowledge can become outdated. RAG allows them to access real-time or frequently updated information.\n",
        "* **Improved Accuracy and Factual Grounding:**\n",
        "    * RAG reduces the risk of LLM \"hallucinations\" (generating false or misleading information) by grounding responses in verified external data.\n",
        "* **Enhanced Contextual Relevance:**\n",
        "    * By providing relevant context, RAG enables LLMs to generate more precise and tailored responses to specific queries.\n",
        "* **Increased Trust and Transparency:**\n",
        "    * RAG can provide source citations, allowing users to verify the information and increasing trust in the LLM's responses.\n",
        "* **Cost Efficiency:**\n",
        "    * Rather than constantly retraining large language models, RAG allows for the introduction of new data in a more cost effective way.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, RAG bridges the gap between the vast knowledge of LLMs and the need for accurate, current, and contextually relevant information.\n"

Existing Tanzania markets, particularly in respect 3\\r\\nof agricultural products is fragmented and spread over so many market places. \\r\\nThe participants who trade on the Exchange can use these near real-time spot \\r\\nprices to take decisions on the futures segment once established. \\r\\nTMX Trading Systems\\r\\nTMX will establish reliable, time tested and transparent trading platforms very \\r\\nsimilar to those being used by successful electronic spot and futures exchanges. \\r\\nTMX will provide screen based trading and hence it will be possible for one to \\r\\nplace trades on the platform without visiting the Exchange.\\r\\nClearing and Settlement Systems\\r\\nFor efficient clearing & settlement of trades, TMX will have an automated clearing \\r\\nand settlement system with the Exchange’s Clearing Banks. TMX’s clearing and \\r\\nSettlement will assume a Central Counter Party (CCP) risk for all members’ trades. \\r\\nIt will establish the net obligations of each member, informs the members of their \\r\\ndaily net obligations and transfers cash funds and commodity ownership among \\r\\nmembers. TMX will identify settlement banks which will have to have dedicated \\r\\nTMX settlement team in their Head Office\\r\\nTMX Central Depository System \\r\\nECX maintains a Central Depository or Registry of warehouse receipts which \\r\\nguarantee product integrity. Manual Receipt issued under the Warehouse \\r\\nReceipts Act, 2010 will be immobilized into Depository Receipt. The TMX \\r\\nCentral Depository is the sole entity authorized to and responsible for issuing \\r\\nDepository Receipt, printing copies of receipts, transferring legal title, and \\r\\ncanceling receipts. The Depository Receipt issued by the TMX Central Depository \\r\\nrepresents legal title to the deposited commodity. The Depository Receipt is \\r\\ntransferable and negotiable on the TMX through the function of the TMX Central \\r\\nDepository. The Central Depository will maintain separate accounts for every \\r\\ndepositor. The Exchange Central Depository will provide the following services:\\r\\n\\tCreate Depository Receipts;\\r\\n\\tMaintain and edit required depository receipt data;\\r\\n\\tMaintain a register of Depositors\\r\\n\\tEffect settlement of contracts traded on the Exchange by transferring \\r\\nDepository Receipts between holders;4\\r\\n\\tIssue Delivery Note after transfer of Depository Receipt;\\r\\n\\tVoid or cancel Depository Receipts;\\r\\n\\tReconcile records daily\\r\\nTrade Surveillance\\r\\nTMX believes that fairness of commodity trading and adequate protection for its \\r\\nparticipants (buyers and sellers) members is essential for a quality market and \\r\\nprerequisite for price discovery. The main activities of TMX market surveillance \\r\\noperations are to preserve the integrity of price discovery process by monitoring \\r\\nthe market to detect and deter the following: \\r\\n•\\t Market manipulation practices- an act by a market participant or a group \\r\\nto deceive in prices or volume of a commodity.\\r\\n•\\t Insider trading – commodity trading made by TMX employee, Board \\r\\nmember or affiliate based on insider information\\r\\n•\\t Misstatement – Rumors or false information to mislead the public in \\r\\nmaking a commodity trading decision. \\r\\n•\\t TMX will use software models for generating real time price, volume, \\r\\nalerts for each trading member’s unusual trade activities. The software \\r\\nwill have a capability to link transaction prices and trades volumes in each \\r\\ncommodity traded in real time, and in the past and if there is unusual \\r\\nchanges in trading pattern will alert the market surveillance team.\\r\\n•\\t Market surveillance team will investigate all unusual trading pattern and \\r\\npass on evidence in a report to the TMX Compliance team for further \\r\\naction if there was sufficient evidence that the exchange’s rules have \\r\\nbeen breached.\\r\\nWarehouse Surveillance\\r\\nPrimarily, the responsibility of warehouse surveillance falls under the purview of \\r\\nthe Tanzania Warehouse Licensing Board. However, in order to minimize risks \\r\\nto the Exchange settlement of commodity leg and in an effort to ensure that \\r\\nTMX build the requisite confidence of the market participants, the Exchange in \\r\\ncollaboration with Tanzania Warehouse Licensing Board, will undertake periodical \\r\\nsnap checks to minimize risks to the exchange and its members.\"\n",
